Here SSCAW refers to "Security System for Cardiac Arrest in Washroom (and other emergencies).

Problem:
So, there is a slight possibility that when the elderly people (or any members of any age group) visit the washroom, they might face some serious health condition, like cardiac arrest etc. Till the time someone finds out about this, it might be too late. Hence, our team of 5 have come up with an idea to manipulate the working of the locks with an Analog circuit, which can help regulate the person's condition inside the bathroom. 

So, initially when the person locks the door, a 10 minute timer begins. After these 10 minutes, a 30 second window would be given to the person. They will have to click a button which would be placed appropriately inside the bathroom. On clicking this button, they would be given an extension of 5 minutes. If a person wants to come out, he/she can press a separate button, which would manually open the lock. This can be done at any time(even in the 30 second window). If the person does not click any button in the 30 second gap, the lock will be opened automatically, and the caretakers would be informed. In this case, we are informing through the use of a buzzer.
